		<h4> Meet me at Beachcomber Bay by Jill Mansell</h4>
		<img src = "meet_me_at_bc_bay.jpg" alt = "The shoreline of a beach with two striped chairs next to each other. The words ' Jill Mansell' ' Meet me at Beachcomber Bay' enlarged" width = "300" height = "400"> 
		<p> It checks all of the boxes of a stereotypical Chick Literature book in all of the best ways. The male and female leads are strung along in forbidden relationship territory.
The most interesting part of the book was the secondary characters' growth over the plot. Personally, I hope for more side stories involving more about St. Cary's. </p>
